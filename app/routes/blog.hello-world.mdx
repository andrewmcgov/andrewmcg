I keep reading that the best way to solidify your knowledge is to write about it. I've set up this site as a way to learn in public, document some helpful info, and have an ongoing side project to tinker on. As a self taught developer, I owe my career to the wonderful people who have shared their knowledge online. Hopefully I can pay it forward a bit here.

I'm a web developer living in Ottawa. I'm a huge Toronto Maple Leafs fan, and play the guitar, and I love cycling.

You can expect posts mostly about JavaScript, TypeScript and React. I'll maybe mix in some personal stuff here and there too, like if the Leafs ever win a playoff series or if the pandemic ever ends and we get to travel again.
